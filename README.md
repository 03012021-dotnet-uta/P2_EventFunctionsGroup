# EventFunctions [Website](https://eventsfunctions.azurewebsites.net)
## Proposal
EventFunctions is a web application for managing, tracking, and planning events including private functions, seminars, and concerts. Using EventFunctions, event managers will be able to create and post events for consumers to see and sign up for. The event managers will be able to provide a variety of information about the event when creating and also see details about events that they have created, ranging from people attending the event to revenue details. The event-goers will be able to find events near them and the sign up for such events. After the event has finished, users will be able to leave a rating and review for the events that they just attended.
